    The ``{% switch %}`` tag compares a variable against one or more values in
    ``{% case %}`` tags, and outputs the contents of the matching block.  An
    optional ``{% else %}`` tag sets off the default output if no matches
    could be found::

                Jackpot! Your search found {{ result_count }} results.
        {% endswitch %}

    Each ``{% case %}`` tag can take multiple values to compare the variable
