This is the OS-side repository for **Building Energy Management Open Source Software (BEMOSS)**, which is an open source operating system that is engineered to improve sensing and control of equipment in small- and medium-sized commercial buildings. 

BEMOSS offers the following key features: 

**Open source, open architecture** – BEMOSS is an open source operating system that is built upon VOLTTRON – a distributed agent platform developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). BEMOSS is designed to make it easy for hardware manufacturers to seamlessly interface their devices with BEMOSS. It is also designed to allow software developers to easily contribute to the platform by adding additional BEMOSS functionalities and applications.

**Plug & play** – BEMOSS is designed to automatically discover supported load controllers (including smart thermostats, VAV/RTUs, lighting load controllers and plug load controllers) in commercial buildings. 

**Interoperability** – BEMOSS is designed to work with load control devices form different manufacturers that operate on different communication technologies and data exchange protocols. 

**Cost effectiveness** – Implementation of BEMOSS is deemed to be cost-effective as it is built upon a robust open source platform that can operate on a low-cost single-board computer, such as BeagleBone. 

**Scalability and ease of deployment** – The BEMOSS operating system is designed with a multi-layer architecture. This makes it possible for a building engineer to deploy BEMOSS in one zone of a building, be comfortable with its operation, and later on expand the deployment to the entire building to make it more energy efficient.

**Ability to provide local and remote monitoring** – BEMOSS provides both local and remote monitoring ability with role-based access control. 

**Security** – In addition to built-in security features provided by VOLTTRON (including agent authorization & authentication, encrypted multi-layer communication and agent validation), BEMOSS operating system has provided enhanced security features. 
 
**Support from the Advisory Committee** – BEMOSS system architecture has been developed in consultation with an advisory committee from the beginning of the project.  As of March 2016, BEMOSS advisory committee comprises representatives from 22 organizations from government and industry.
